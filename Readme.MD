# WEATHER FORECAST

- In Weather forecast project we can check cities temperature, wind and climate of cities.

For these project I used:
- HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, OpenWeatherMap API

Details of UI:
- User will get the "search-box" to enter city name then it need to click on search then it details of climate of that city.
- It also provides next 5-days forecast also.
- There was also a "Use Current Location" button it will automatically choose the location of your with help of your device GPS acces.
- To use "Use Current Location" you need to give access to location of your device and need to turn on "GPS" then it will work.
